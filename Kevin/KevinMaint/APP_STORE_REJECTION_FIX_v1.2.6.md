## Root Cause Analysis

The ProfileView had several menu items with empty action handlers marked with `// TODO:` comments. When Apple's reviewer tapped on these menu items on iPad, nothing happened, causing the app to appear non-functional.

**Affected Menu Items:**
1. **Account Settings** - Had `// TODO: Navigate to account settings`
2. **Notifications** - Had `// TODO: Navigate to notification settings`  
3. **Help & FAQ** - Had `// TODO: Navigate to help`
4. **Contact Kevin's Team** - Had `// TODO: Open contact form`

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Missing Views

**AccountSettingsView.swift**
- Profile information editing (name, phone)
- Account information display (role, restaurant)
- Save changes functionality with Firebase integration
- Read-only email field with explanation

**NotificationSettingsView.swift**
- System notification status check
- Push notification preferences

**ContactSupportView.swift**
- Support category selection (General, Technical, Billing, Feature Request, Urgent)

### 2. Updated ProfileView Navigation

- Wrapped menu items in `NavigationLink` for proper navigation
- Added sheet presentations for modal views (Contact Support, Bug Report)
- All menu items now have functional actions
- Maintained consistent UI/UX with PlainButtonStyle

### 3. Fixed Compilation Issues
