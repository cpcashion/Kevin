## Problem Fixed

**Before:** 
- Timeline shows truncated work updates (e.g., quotes, messages)
- No way to see full details
- Users see "I've ordered the replacement..." but can't read the rest
- Frustrating for restaurant owners who need complete information

**After:**
- ✅ All timeline items are now tappable
- ✅ Tap any work update → See full message in detail view
- ✅ Visual indicator shows "Tap to view full details"
- ✅ Beautiful detail view with complete message, metadata, and timestamps
- ✅ Complete transparency for quotes, updates, and status changes

## 🎨 What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Tappable Timeline Items** ✅

Every item in the Progress Timeline is now a button:
- Clear visual feedback when tapping

### 2. **Timeline Event Detail View** ✅

Beautiful full-screen detail view showing:
- **Full message text** - No truncation, see everything

- **Author information** - Who posted the update
- **Event type badge** - "Work Update" or "Status Change"
- **Metadata** - Work log ID, author ID, creation date

### 3. **Visual Improvements** ✅

- Color-coded indicators (blue for work updates, green for status)
- Professional card-based layout
- Proper spacing and typography
- Consistent with app theme
