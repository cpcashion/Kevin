# Cost Prediction System - Executive Summary

## 🎯 The Problem You Identified

When a restaurant operator snaps a photo of a broken shelf or hole in the wall, they need to know:
**"What's this going to cost?"**

Without this answer, they can't:
- Approve the repair confidently
- Budget appropriately  
- Understand Kevin's value
- Make fast decisions

## 💡 The Solution We Built

A **sophisticated cost prediction engine** that provides instant, location-aware cost estimates the moment they take a photo.

### What It Does

```
Operator snaps photo of broken drywall
    ↓
AI analyzes: "3x4 foot hole, needs 2 sheets drywall, 3.5 hours labor"
    ↓
Cost engine calculates based on:
    - Davidson, NC regional pricing
    - Drywall specialist rates ($55/hr)
    - Material costs with local multipliers
    - Kevin's 15% coordination fee
    ↓
Shows: "$250-$400 (Most likely: $325)"
        "Save $130 (28%) vs typical market price"
```
