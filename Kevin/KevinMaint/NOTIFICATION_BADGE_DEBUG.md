# ðŸ”” Notification Badge Debugging Guide

## Why Badges Might Not Show

### 1. **Notification Permissions**
Check if badges are enabled:

**Test in app:**
```swift
NotificationService.shared.debugBadgeSettings()
```

**Expected output:**
```
Badge setting: 2 (enabled)
Authorization status: 3 (authorized)
```

**If badge setting is 0 (not allowed):**
- User denied badge permission
- Go to Settings > Kevin > Notifications > Enable "Badges"

### 2. **APNS Configuration**
Badges require APNS (Apple Push Notification Service), not just local notifications.

**Check:**
- Do you have an APNS certificate in Firebase Console?
- Is the app registered for remote notifications?

**Test:**
- Send a real push notification from another device
- Local notifications won't show badges unless manually set

### 3. **Cloud Function Badge Payload**
The Cloud Function MUST include badge in APNS payload.

**Current implementation (CORRECT):**
```javascript
apns: {
  payload: {
    aps: {
      badge: 1,  // âœ… This increments badge
      sound: 'default',
    },
  },
}
```

### 4. **Badge Persistence**
Badge count should persist across app restarts.

**Test:**
1. Receive notification (badge shows "1")
2. Kill app
3. Reopen app
4. Badge should still show "1"

**If badge disappears:**
- Check UserDefaults storage is working
- Run: `NotificationService.shared.debugBadgeSettings()`

## Quick Debug Checklist

Run these commands in your app to diagnose:

1. **Check Permission Status**
```swift
NotificationService.shared.debugNotificationStatus()
```

2. **Check FCM Token**
```swift
NotificationService.shared.debugFCMTokenStatus()
```

3. **Check Badge Count**
```swift
print("Current badge: \(UIApplication.shared.applicationIconBadgeNumber)")
print("Stored badge: \(UserDefaults.standard.integer(forKey: "appBadgeCount"))")
```

4. **Test Local Notification with Badge**
```swift
NotificationService.shared.testBadgeNotification()
```

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Badge is always 0"
**Cause:** App never registered for remote notifications  
**Fix:** Check `UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications()` is called

### Issue: "Badge shows but doesn't increment"
**Cause:** Cloud Function not sending badge in payload  
**Fix:** Redeploy Cloud Function with APNS badge config

### Issue: "Badge resets to 0 on app launch"
**Cause:** Badge persistence not working  
**Fix:** Check `syncBadgeCountWithSystem()` restores from UserDefaults

### Issue: "Notifications arrive but no badge"
**Cause:** User has badges disabled in Settings  
**Fix:** User must enable in Settings > Kevin > Notifications > Badges

## Manual Test

### Test 1: Local Notification Badge
```swift
let content = UNMutableNotificationContent()
content.title = "Test"
content.body = "Testing badge"
content.badge = 1  // Set badge to 1

let request = UNNotificationRequest(
  identifier: UUID().uuidString,
  content: content,
  trigger: UNTimeIntervalNotificationTrigger(timeInterval: 5, repeats: false)
)

UNUserNotificationCenter.current().add(request)
```

**Expected:** After 5 seconds, app icon shows badge "1"

### Test 2: Remote Push Notification
1. Create issue from another device/user
2. Check Firebase Console > Cloud Functions logs
3. Look for "Successfully sent X notifications"
4. Badge should appear on your app icon

## Production Checklist

âœ… APNS certificate configured in Firebase  
âœ… App registered for remote notifications  
âœ… Cloud Function includes `badge: 1` in APNS payload  
âœ… User granted notification permissions with badges  
âœ… Badge persistence implemented (UserDefaults)  
âœ… Badge clears when notification tapped  

If all checked and badges still don't work, the issue is likely:
1. APNS certificate not configured in Firebase
2. Running on simulator (badges only work on real devices)
3. User disabled badges in system settings
