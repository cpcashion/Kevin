## ‚úÖ Pre-Submit Verification

Quick test before submitting:
- [ ] Login with demo@kevinmaint.app works
- [ ] "Try Demo Mode" button visible
- [ ] 5 demo issues appear in Issues tab
- [ ] Screenshots show BOTH sign-in options
- [ ] iPad screenshots show app features (not just login)

---

## üìß Demo Credentials (Copy/Paste Ready)

**For App Store Connect ‚Üí App Review Information:**

```
EASIEST METHOD - Just tap "Try Demo Mode" button:
The app has a "Try Demo Mode" button on the sign-in screen that 
automatically signs in with demo credentials and loads demo data.

ALTERNATIVE - Manual sign-in:
Email: demo@kevinmaint.app
Password: DemoKevin2025!
Use either Google Sign-In or Apple Sign-In with these credentials.

The demo account includes:
- 5 sample maintenance issues (various statuses)
- AI analysis results  
- Location data (The Demo Bistro, San Francisco)
- Work logs and timeline
- All features fully functional

HOW IT WORKS:
The "Try Demo Mode" button automatically signs into Firebase with
the demo account, so all data is real and persisted in the database.
No mock data - everything works exactly like production.
```
