# 🔔 Activity Feed - Standard UX Implementation

## Problem Solved

**Before:** User sees 5 badge notifications on app icon but tapping the app just opens the app normally. No way to see what the notifications were about.

**After:** User taps app icon with badges → Automatically opens Activity Feed showing all recent notifications with ability to tap and navigate to each one.

---

## ✅ What's Implemented

### 1. **NotificationHistoryService** ✅
Tracks all incoming notifications in memory and persistent storage.

**Features:**
- Stores up to 50 recent notifications
- Persists across app restarts (UserDefaults)
- Tracks read/unread status
- Provides unread count
- Auto-logs when notifications arrive

### 2. **ActivityFeedView** ✅
Beautiful notification center UI showing all recent activity.

**Features:**
- List of all notifications with icons, colors, and timestamps
- Unread indicator (blue dot)
- "Mark All as Read" option
- "Clear All" option
- Tap notification → Navigate to issue or conversation
- Empty state when no notifications
- Auto-marks as read when viewed

### 3. **Auto-Launch on App Open** ✅
App automatically shows Activity Feed when launched with badges.

**Flow:**
1. User has 5 notifications (badge shows "5")
2. User taps app icon
3. App launches
4. After 0.5 seconds, checks badge count
5. If badge > 0, automatically opens Activity Feed
6. User sees all 5 notifications in a list
7. User taps notification → Opens that specific issue/message
8. Activity Feed marks as read → Badge clears

## 🎯 User Experience

### For Restaurant Owners

**Scenario:** Owner hasn't opened Kevin app in 2 days. They have 7 notifications.

**Current UX:**
1. Sees badge "7" on app icon
2. Taps app icon
3. **Activity Feed automatically opens**
4. Sees list of 7 updates:
   - "Work Update: Banana Stand - Jamie posted an update..."
   - "Status Changed: Freezer issue is now In Progress"
   - "New Message: Chris replied about broken stove"
   - "Work Update: Broken oven - Parts ordered..."
   - etc.
5. Taps "Freezer issue" notification
6. Jumps directly to that issue detail
7. Reads update, sees status
8. Closes - badge now shows "6"
9. Returns to Activity Feed
10. Taps next notification
11. Continues until all caught up

**Result:** Owner knows exactly what happened while they were away and can efficiently review all updates.

├─────────────────────────────────┤
│                                 │
│  🟢  Work Update             • │
│      New Update: Banana Stand   │

│  ... more notifications ...     │
│                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Design Details:**
- Color-coded icons for different notification types
- Blue dot for unread notifications
- Relative timestamps (2h ago, 1d ago)
- Two-line preview of notification content
- Tap entire row to navigate
- Menu button (⋯) for bulk actions

### Empty State

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  ← Close        Activity    ⋯   │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│                                 │
│           🔕                    │
