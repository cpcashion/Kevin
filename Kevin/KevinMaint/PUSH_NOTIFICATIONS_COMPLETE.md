# üîî Push Notifications System - Complete Implementation Guide

## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed + NEW Activity Feed!

### üÜï **Activity Feed - Standard App UX** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** User sees 5 badges but tapping app doesn't show them what's new.

**Solution:** 
- Created ActivityFeedView showing all recent notifications
- App automatically opens feed when launched with badges > 0
- User can tap any notification to navigate to that issue/message
- Notifications persist across app restarts
- Mark as read / Clear all functionality

**Result:** Perfect UX like every other app! Tap app icon with badges ‚Üí See all updates ‚Üí Tap to navigate.

### 1. **Cloud Function - Badge & Deep Linking** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Push notifications didn't include badge increments or complete data for deep linking.

**Solution:**
- Added APNS payload with badge increment (`badge: 1`)
- Included ALL data fields (issueId, conversationId, issueTitle, updateType, etc.)
- Notifications now increment badge automatically on iOS

### 2. **Issue Creation Notifications** ‚úÖ
**Status:** Already implemented in `FirebaseClient.createIssue()`

**Flow:**
1. User creates issue with photo
2. Issue saved to Firestore
3. Notification sent to all admins
4. Push notification includes: `issueId`, `title`, `restaurantName`, `priority`

### 3. **Issue Update Notifications** ‚úÖ
**Status:** Already implemented in `IssueDetailView`

**Flow:**
1. Admin/user adds work log or updates status
2. Notification sent to relevant users (owner, admins, or participants)
3. Push includes: `issueId`, `updateType`, `issueTitle`, `updatedBy`

### 4. **Message Notifications** ‚úÖ
**Status:** Already implemented in `MessagingService.sendMessageNotifications()`

**Flow:**
1. User sends message in conversation
2. Notification sent to all conversation participants (except sender)
3. Push includes: `conversationId`, `senderId`, `senderName`, `issueId` (if issue-related)

### 5. **Deep Linking** ‚úÖ
**Status:** Fully functional

**Implementation:**
- `NotificationService` handles notification taps
- Posts to `NotificationCenter` with proper routes
- `RootView` listens and navigates to correct screen
- Supported types:
  - `work_update` ‚Üí Opens issue detail
  - `issue` ‚Üí Opens issue detail  
  - `message` ‚Üí Opens conversation
  - `receipt_status` ‚Üí Opens issue with receipts tab
  - `issue_status` ‚Üí Opens issue detail

## üéØ How It Works Now

### Complete Notification Flow

```
1. EVENT HAPPENS (issue created, message sent, etc.)
   ‚Üì
2. App calls NotificationService.sendXXXNotification()
   ‚Üì
3. NotificationService creates notification trigger in Firestore
   ‚Üì
4. Cloud Function detects new trigger document
   ‚Üì
5. Function looks up user FCM tokens
   ‚Üì
6. Sends push with COMPLETE data + badge increment
   ‚Üì
7. iOS receives push, increments badge, shows notification
   ‚Üì
8. User taps notification
   ‚Üì
9. NotificationService.userNotificationCenter(didReceive:)
   ‚Üì
10. Posts to NotificationCenter with issueId/conversationId
    ‚Üì
11. RootView.handleNavigateToIssue() switches to correct tab
    ‚Üì
12. User sees the exact issue/message they were notified about
```

## üì± Notification Types & Payloads

### Issue Creation
```json
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "New High Priority Issue",
    "body": "Banana Stand: Broken freezer compressor"
  },
  "data": {
    "type": "issue",
    "issueId": "abc123",
    "restaurantName": "Banana Stand",
    "priority": "high"
  },
  "apns": {
    "payload": {
      "aps": {
        "badge": 1,
        "sound": "default"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Work Update
```json
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "New Update: Banana Stand",
    "body": "Kevin Admin posted an update on 'Broken freezer...'"
  },
  "data": {
    "type": "work_update",
    "issueId": "abc123",
    "issueTitle": "Broken freezer compressor",
    "updateType": "work_log",
    "updatedBy": "Kevin Admin"
  },
  "apns": {
    "payload": {
      "aps": {
        "badge": 1,
        "sound": "default"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Message
```json
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "Chris Cashion replied",
    "body": "About 'Broken freezer' at Banana Stand: Can you send more photos?"
  },
  "data": {
    "type": "message",
    "conversationId": "xyz789",
    "senderId": "user123",
    "senderName": "Chris Cashion",
    "issueId": "abc123",
    "issueTitle": "Broken freezer compressor"
  },
  "apns": {
    "payload": {
      "aps": {
        "badge": 1,
        "sound": "default"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## ‚úÖ Badge Count Persistence - IMPLEMENTED

### Badge Count Now Persists Across App Restarts ‚úÖ

**Implementation:**
- Badge count saved to UserDefaults on every change
- Restored automatically on app launch via `syncBadgeCountWithSystem()`
- Clears properly when notification tapped
- Survives app restarts, phone reboots, and app updates

**Behavior:**
1. Notification arrives ‚Üí Badge increments ‚Üí Saved to UserDefaults
2. App killed/restarted ‚Üí Badge restored from UserDefaults on launch
3. User taps notification ‚Üí Badge clears ‚Üí UserDefaults updated to 0
4. Multiple notifications accumulate correctly

**No Further Action Needed!**

### Background Fetch ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Current:** App receives notifications but doesn't update data in background.

**Future Enhancement:** 
Implement background fetch to update issues/messages when notification arrives while app is killed.

## üîß How to Debug Notifications

### 1. Check FCM Token
```swift
NotificationService.shared.debugFCMTokenStatus()
```
Verify user has valid FCM token in Firestore.

### 2. Check Cloud Function Logs
```bash
firebase functions:log --only sendNotifications
```
Look for:
- "Processing notification for X users"
- "Found FCM token for user..."
- "Successfully sent X notifications"

### 3. Check Firestore Triggers
Look at `notificationTriggers` collection:
- `processed: true` ‚Üí Successfully sent
- `successCount` ‚Üí Number of devices reached
- `error` ‚Üí Any failures

### 4. Test Local Notifications
```swift
NotificationService.shared.showLocalNotification(
  title: "Test",
  body: "Testing notification",
  userInfo: ["type": "work_update", "issueId": "test123"]
)
```

### 5. Monitor Badge Count
```swift
NotificationService.shared.debugBadgeSettings()
```
Check authorization status and current badge count.

## üöÄ Deployment Status

‚úÖ **Cloud Function:** Deployed with badge support (Oct 10, 2025)  
‚úÖ **Firestore Rules:** `notificationTriggers` collection accessible  
‚úÖ **iOS App:** NotificationService fully implemented  
‚úÖ **Deep Linking:** RootView handlers active  

---

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Always include issueId or conversationId** in notification data
2. **Use meaningful notification titles** that include context (restaurant name, etc.)
3. **Keep notification body under 178 characters** for iOS lockscreen visibility
4. **Include sender name** in message notifications for context
5. **Use type field** to properly route deep links
6. **Test on real device** - simulator doesn't support APNS
7. **Monitor Cloud Function logs** for debugging

---

## üéì Understanding the Architecture

### Client-Side (iOS)
- **NotificationService**: Manages permissions, FCM tokens, local notifications
- **FirebaseClient**: Writes to `notificationTriggers` collection
- **AppDelegate**: Receives APNS token, handles background notifications
- **RootView**: Listens to NotificationCenter, handles deep linking

### Server-Side (Cloud Functions)
- **sendNotifications**: Listens to `notificationTriggers` collection
- Looks up user FCM tokens
- Sends multicast push with complete payload
- Marks trigger as processed

### Data Flow
- App writes to `notificationTriggers` ‚Üí Cloud Function reads ‚Üí FCM sends ‚Üí iOS receives ‚Üí User taps ‚Üí App navigates
