## What You Need to Do

### üî¥ CRITICAL (30 minutes of work)

Add 4 function calls to existing code:

#### 1. Status Changes (5 minutes)
**File:** `MaintenanceServiceV2.swift`  
**Line:** ~140 in `updateStatus()` function  
**Action:** Call `sendStatusChangeNotification()` after status update

#### 2. Photo Uploads (5 minutes)
**File:** `IssueDetailView.swift`  
**Line:** After photo upload success  
**Action:** Call `sendPhotoUploadNotification()` after photos saved

#### 3. Quotes (10 minutes)
**File:** `QuoteAssistantView.swift`  
**Line:** After quote saved & after quote approved  
**Action:** Call `sendQuoteNotification()` and `sendQuoteApprovedNotification()`

#### 4. Invoices (10 minutes)
**File:** `InvoiceBuilderView.swift`  
**Line:** After invoice saved & after payment recorded  
**Action:** Call `sendInvoiceNotification()` and `sendInvoicePaidNotification()`

**See NOTIFICATION_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md for exact code to add.**
