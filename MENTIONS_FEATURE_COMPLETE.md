# @ Mentions Feature - Complete âœ…

## Overview
Implemented a full @ mentions feature in the issue messaging system, similar to Slack/WhatsApp/iMessage.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Mention Autocomplete**
- Type `@` in any message to see a list of mentionable users
- List filters as you type (e.g., `@kev` shows Kevin, etc.)
- Shows user's full name and email prefix
- Tap a user to insert their mention

### 2. **Mention Format**
- Clean format: `@Kevin Cashion` (no quotes!)
- Works with names that have spaces
- Mentions are stored in plain text in messages

### 3. **Push Notifications** âœ…
- **YES, notifications ARE sent!**
- When you mention someone with `@Name`, they receive a push notification
- Notification shows: "ðŸ’¬ [Your Name] mentioned you"
- Tapping the notification opens the issue

### 4. **User Filtering**
- **Admins**: Can mention ALL users from any location
- **Non-admins**: Can mention users at their location + all admins
- Currently showing all users (location filtering ready for future)

## How It Works

### For Users:
1. Open an issue
2. Tap the message field
3. Type `@` - autocomplete appears with all users
4. Type more letters to filter (e.g., `@kev`)
5. Tap a user to insert mention
6. Send message
7. Mentioned user gets a push notification

### Technical Implementation:

**Files Modified:**
- `IssueDetailView.swift` - Added mention UI and logic
- `UserProfileService.swift` - User loading and mention parsing
- `MentionAutocompleteView.swift` - Autocomplete UI component
- `NotificationService.swift` - Mention notifications

**Key Components:**
1. **State Management**
   - `mentionableUsers` - All users that can be mentioned
   - `filteredMentionUsers` - Filtered list based on query
   - `showingMentionAutocomplete` - Show/hide autocomplete
   - `currentMentionQuery` - Current search text

2. **Functions**
   - `loadMentionableUsers()` - Loads users on view appear
   - `handleMessageTextChange()` - Detects @ and filters users
   - `insertMention()` - Inserts selected user into message
   - `notifyMentionedUsers()` - Sends push notifications

3. **Mention Detection**
   - Regex pattern: `@([A-Z][a-zA-Z]*(?:\s+[A-Z][a-zA-Z]*)*)`
   - Matches: `@Kevin`, `@Kevin Cashion`, `@Chris Cashion`
   - Case-insensitive matching for user lookup

## Notifications Confirmed Working âœ…

From your logs:
```
ðŸ”” [NotificationService] Sending mention notification
ðŸ”” [NotificationService] - Mentioned users: 1
ðŸ”” [NotificationService] Creating local notification:
ðŸ”” [NotificationService] - Title: ðŸ’¬ Chris Cashion mentioned you
âœ… [NotificationService] Local notification scheduled successfully
âœ… [FirebaseClient] Created notification trigger for 1 users
âœ… [NotificationService] Notification trigger sent
```

**The system IS sending notifications!** Both:
1. Local notifications (for testing in simulator)
2. Firebase Cloud Messaging triggers (for real devices)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Mention Highlighting
To make mentions appear in **bold pink** in the timeline:
1. Parse message text for mentions
2. Use `AttributedString` with custom styling
3. Apply pink color + bold weight to @mentions

### Location-Based Filtering
When ready to implement:
1. Add `assignedLocations` array field to user documents
2. Update `getUsersAtLocation()` to use the field
3. Filter mentions based on user's assigned locations
