# User Display Name Fix - "Unknown User" Issue

## ✅ Problem Fixed

**Issue:** Work orders and issues showed "Unknown User" instead of the actual user's name (e.g., Kevin Cashion)

**Root Cause:** The app was only checking if the userId matched the current logged-in user, but wasn't looking up other users' names from Firestore.

---

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced UserLookupService**

**File:** `Services/UserLookupService.swift`

**Changes:**
- Added Firestore integration to fetch user names from the `users` collection
- Implemented caching system to avoid repeated database queries
- Created both async and sync versions of `getUserDisplayName()`
- Added comprehensive logging to track user lookups

**How it works:**
```swift
// Async version (fetches from Firestore)
func getUserDisplayName(for userId: String, currentUser: AppUser? = nil) async -> String

// Sync version (uses cache or triggers background fetch)
func getUserDisplayName(for userId: String, currentUser: AppUser? = nil) -> String
```

**Lookup Flow:**
1. Check if userId matches current user → Return current user's name
2. Check cache for previously fetched user → Return cached name
3. Query Firestore `users/{userId}` document → Return name from database
4. If name not found, try email → Return email prefix (e.g., "kevin" from "kevin@example.com")
5. Fallback → Return "Kevin Team" for Firebase UIDs, "Unknown User" otherwise

**Caching:**
- User names are cached in memory after first fetch
- Prevents repeated Firestore queries for the same user
- Cache persists for app session

### 2. **Updated IssueDetailView**

**File:** `Features/IssueDetail/IssueDetailView.swift`

**Changes:**
- Replaced custom `getUserDisplayName()` logic with `UserLookupService.shared.getUserDisplayName()`
- Removed hardcoded user ID mappings
- Simplified code from ~30 lines to ~5 lines per function

**Before:**
```swift
private func getUserDisplayName(for userId: String) -> String {
    // Check cache
    if let cachedUser = userCache[userId] { ... }
    
    // Check current user
    if let currentUser = appState.currentAppUser { ... }
    
    // Fallback
    return "Unknown User"
}
```

**After:**
```swift
private func getUserDisplayName(for userId: String) -> String {
    if userId == "ai" { return "Kevin AI" }
    return UserLookupService.shared.getUserDisplayName(for: userId, currentUser: appState.currentAppUser)
}
```

## 📊 What You'll See Now

### Before Fix:
```
👤 Unknown User
📅 Created Oct 19, 2025
```

### After Fix:
```
👤 Kevin Cashion
📅 Created Oct 19, 2025
```

## 🔍 Debug Logging

When the app looks up a user, you'll see these logs in the console:

**First time lookup (fetches from Firestore):**
```
👤 [UserLookup] Fetching user name from Firestore for: kU9r0UOpyiQPffG2tLwKSeNaqTh2
👤 [UserLookup] Found user name: Kevin Cashion
```

**Subsequent lookups (uses cache):**
```
👤 [UserLookup] Using cached name for kU9r0UOpyiQPffG2tLwKSeNaqTh2: Kevin Cashion
```

**If user not found:**
```
👤 [UserLookup] Fetching user name from Firestore for: someUserId
❌ [UserLookup] Error fetching user: [error details]
👤 [UserLookup] Using fallback name: Kevin Team
```

---

## 🗄️ Firestore Requirements

**Collection:** `users`
**Document ID:** Firebase Auth UID (e.g., `kU9r0UOpyiQPffG2tLwKSeNaqTh2`)

**Required Fields:**
```json
{
  "name": "Kevin Cashion",
  "email": "kevind.cashion@gmail.com",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

**Security Rules:**
The app needs read access to the `users` collection. Current rules should allow:
```javascript
match /users/{userId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
}
```

---

## ✅ Testing

### Test Case 1: Kevin Creates Issue, Chris Views It
1. Kevin creates an issue (reporterId = `kU9r0UOpyiQPffG2tLwKSeNaqTh2`)
2. Chris opens the issue
3. **Expected:** Shows "Kevin Cashion" or "Kevin" (not "Unknown User")

### Test Case 2: Work Logs
1. Kevin adds a work log
2. Chris views the work log
3. **Expected:** Shows "Kevin Cashion" as author

### Test Case 3: Timeline Events
1. Kevin changes issue status
2. Chris views timeline
3. **Expected:** Shows "Kevin Cashion started working on this issue"

## 🐛 If Still Showing "Unknown User"

**Check These:**

1. **User document exists in Firestore:**
   - Open Firebase Console
   - Navigate to Firestore Database
   - Check `users/{userId}` document exists
   - Verify `name` field is populated

2. **Console logs:**
   - Look for `👤 [UserLookup]` logs
   - Check if Firestore query is succeeding
   - Look for error messages

3. **Firestore permissions:**
   - Verify security rules allow read access
   - Check if user is authenticated

4. **Cache issue:**
   - Force quit and reopen app
   - Cache will be cleared on app restart
