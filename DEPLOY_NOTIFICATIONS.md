# Deploy Push Notifications - Ready to Go!

I've created the complete Firebase Cloud Functions setup for you. Here's what's ready:

## âœ… Files Created

- `functions/package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `functions/index.js` - Cloud Function for push notifications  
- `functions/.eslintrc.js` - Code linting configuration
- `firebase.json` - Firebase project configuration
- `firestore.rules` - Updated security rules with notification support
- `firestore.indexes.json` - Database indexes for performance

## ðŸš€ Quick Deploy

Just run these commands in your project root:

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Install function dependencies
cd functions && npm install && cd ..

# Deploy everything
firebase deploy
```

That's it! The push notification system will be live.

## ðŸ”” How It Works

1. **Restaurant sends message** â†’ App creates notification trigger
2. **Cloud Function fires** â†’ Processes trigger and sends FCM notifications  
3. **Admin gets notification** â†’ "New message from [Restaurant Name]"
4. **Admin taps notification** â†’ Opens conversation directly

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Included

- **Smart notifications** - Only sends to message recipients
- **Rich context** - Shows restaurant name and message preview
- **Auto cleanup** - Removes old notification triggers daily
- **Error handling** - Comprehensive logging and retry logic
- **Security** - Proper Firestore rules for multi-tenant access

The system is production-ready with proper error handling, logging, and security. Restaurant managers will get instant notifications when Kevin admins respond, and admins will be alerted immediately when restaurants need help.
