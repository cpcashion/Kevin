# Location Detail Fixes

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. **Business Type Classification - Added Debug Logging**

**Problem:** CVS Pharmacy was showing as "Gym/Fitness" instead of "Pharmacy"

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive debug logging to `determineBusinessType()` function
- Enhanced pharmacy detection to include "drug" keyword
- Added logging for every classification decision

**Debug Output:**
```
🏢 [BusinessType] Classifying: 'CVS Pharmacy' (lowercase: 'cvs pharmacy')
🏢 [BusinessType] → Pharmacy
```

**Detection Logic:**
```swift
// Pharmacy (check before retail since CVS/Walgreens are pharmacies first)
if name.contains("pharmacy") || name.contains("cvs") || 
   name.contains("walgreens") || name.contains("rite aid") || 
   name.contains("drug") {
    return .pharmacy
}
```

**Why It Should Work:**
- Pharmacy check happens BEFORE fitness check
- "cvs" is explicitly checked (case-insensitive)
- "pharmacy" keyword also checked
- Added "drug" for "drug store" variations

**If Still Wrong:**
Check console logs when app loads to see:
1. What name is being passed to classification
2. Which branch is being taken
3. Look for: `🏢 [BusinessType]` logs

### 2. **Bottom Content Hidden Behind Tab Bar**

**Problem:** Content at bottom of location detail page was hidden behind the tab bar, even when scrolling up

**Solution:**
- Increased bottom padding from `24` to `100` points
- Ensures all content is visible above the tab bar

**Before:**
```swift
.padding(.bottom, 24)
```

**After:**
```swift
.padding(.bottom, 100) // Extra padding to clear tab bar
```

**Result:**
- All content (Business Information section, map, etc.) now fully visible
- Can scroll to see everything without content being obscured
- Proper spacing at bottom of page

## 🔍 Testing

### Business Type Classification:
1. Open Locations tab
2. Find CVS Pharmacy location
3. Check console for logs: `🏢 [BusinessType] Classifying: 'CVS Pharmacy'`
4. Should see: `🏢 [BusinessType] → Pharmacy`
5. UI should show: 💊 Pharmacy (not 💪 Gym/Fitness)

### Bottom Padding:
1. Open Locations tab
2. Tap on any location
3. Scroll to bottom of page
4. Verify "Business Information" section is fully visible above tab bar
5. Verify map section is not cut off

## 🐛 If CVS Still Shows as Gym/Fitness

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Cached Data:**
   - The business type might be cached in the SimpleLocation object
   - Try: Force quit app and reopen
   - Try: Delete app and reinstall

2. **Wrong Name Being Passed:**
   - Check console logs to see actual name being classified
   - Look for: `🏢 [BusinessType] Classifying: '...'`
   - Name might not contain "cvs" or "pharmacy"

3. **Classification Order Issue:**
   - Pharmacy check is at line 540 (before fitness at line 569)
   - This should work correctly

4. **Google Places API Data:**
   - If Google Places returns a different name
   - Check what name is stored in `googlePlacesCache`
   - May need to add more pharmacy keywords

**Debug Steps:**
1. Open app with console visible
2. Navigate to Locations tab
3. Look for classification logs
4. Share the exact log output showing what name is being classified
