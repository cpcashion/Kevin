# AI Agent Implementation - Kevin Maint

## Overview

Successfully implemented a conversational AI agent system using OpenAI Assistants API that provides full context awareness and intelligent assistance for managing maintenance work orders.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **AIAssistantService** (`Services/AIAssistantService.swift`)
   - Manages OpenAI Assistants API integration
   - Handles thread creation (one thread per work order)
   - Manages function calling for AI actions
   - Polls for completion and handles streaming responses

2. **AIContextService** (`Services/AIContextService.swift`)
   - Builds comprehensive context for each work order
   - Aggregates events from photos, messages, voice notes, status changes
   - Detects user intents (quote requests, urgency, scheduling)
   - Maintains context cache for performance
   - Stores context in Firestore for persistence

3. **WorkOrderContext** (`Models/WorkOrderContext.swift`)
   - Structured context model with timeline events
   - AI analysis history
   - Detected user intents
   - Business logic state (quotes, scheduling, costs)
   - Generates context summaries for AI prompts

4. **AIAgentView** (`Features/AIAgent/AIAgentView.swift`)
   - Chat-style interface for conversing with AI
   - Proactive suggestions based on context
   - Message bubbles with timestamps
   - Loading indicators and error handling
   - Integration with existing theme system

## How It Works

### Context Building

When admin opens an issue, the system:

1. **Aggregates Timeline Events**:
   - Photo uploads with AI analysis
   - Voice notes with transcriptions
   - Status changes
   - Messages and updates
   - Receipt uploads

2. **Detects User Intents**:
   - Quote requests ("can you give me a quote?")
   - Urgency indicators ("urgent", "asap", "emergency")
   - Scheduling requests ("when can you come?")
   - Budget mentions
   - Callback requests

3. **Builds Business State**:
   - Current status
   - Estimated costs from AI analysis
   - Quote generation status
   - Scheduling information
   - Suggested actions

### AI Conversation Flow

**Example Interaction:**

```
[Admin opens issue]

AI: "Summit Coffee has bathroom trim damage. Sarah wants a quote. 
     Based on the photo, I estimate $250-350 for 6ft baseboard replacement. 
     What should I quote?"

Admin: "quote $300"

AI: "Perfect. I'll create a quote for $300. Should I include:
     - Labor: $180
     - Materials: $120
     Or would you like to adjust the breakdown?"

Admin: "looks good, send it"

AI: "Quote sent to Sarah at Summit Coffee. I'll notify you when she responds.
     Want me to schedule this for next Tuesday when you're in that area?"

Admin: "yes"

AI: "✓ Scheduled for Tuesday 2PM. I'll send Sarah a confirmation."
```

### Function Calling

The AI can execute these actions:

1. **create_quote**: Generate quotes with cost breakdown
2. **send_quote**: Send quotes to customers
3. **schedule_work**: Schedule appointments
4. **send_message**: Send messages to customers
5. **update_status**: Update work order status
6. **estimate_cost**: Calculate repair costs

Each function requires confirmation before execution for safety.

## Integration Points

### IssueDetailView

- **AI Button**: Purple gradient button in toolbar (admin only)
- **Context Loading**: Builds context when AI button tapped
- **Sheet Presentation**: Full-screen AI chat interface
- **Real-time Updates**: Context updates as events occur

### Proactive Suggestions

AI generates suggestions based on context:

- **Quote Request Detected**: "Create Quote for $250-350"
- **Quote Approved**: "Schedule Work"
- **Urgent Issue**: "Prioritize Scheduling"

Suggestions appear as cards at the top of the chat interface.

## Cost Analysis

### OpenAI Assistants API Pricing

- **GPT-4o Model**: $2.50/1M input tokens, $10/1M output tokens
- **Context Building**: $0.02-0.05 per work order (one-time)
- **Chat Interactions**: $0.01-0.03 per message exchange
- **Function Calls**: $0.005 per action

### Projected Costs

**Per Work Order with AI Assistance:**
- Photo analysis: $0.03
- Context setup: $0.04
- 3 chat exchanges: $0.06
- 2 function calls: $0.01
- **Total: ~$0.14 per work order**

**Monthly Estimates:**
- 100 work orders/month: **$14/month**
- 1,000 work orders/month: **$140/month**

## Technical Implementation

### Context Storage

```
Firestore Structure:
workOrders/{workOrderId}/aiContext/current
  - workOrderId
  - locationId, locationName
  - reporterId, reporterName
  - events[] (timeline)
  - aiAnalyses[]
  - detectedIntents[]
  - businessState
  - createdAt, updatedAt
```

### Thread Management

- One OpenAI thread per work order
- Thread IDs cached in memory and Firestore
- Persistent conversations across app sessions
- Context injected with each AI run

### Intent Detection

Pattern matching for common intents:
- "quote", "estimate", "how much" → Quote Request
- "urgent", "asap", "emergency" → Urgency
- "schedule", "when can", "appointment" → Scheduling
- "$", "budget", "afford" → Budget Info
- "call me", "call back" → Callback Request

## User Experience

### Admin Flow

1. **Open Issue**: View issue details with timeline
2. **Tap AI Button**: Purple "AI" button in toolbar
3. **See Proactive Message**: AI analyzes context and suggests actions
4. **Chat Naturally**: Type commands like "quote $300" or "schedule tuesday"
5. **Confirm Actions**: Review and confirm before AI executes
6. **Get Results**: AI provides feedback and next steps

### Proactive Suggestions

AI automatically suggests actions:
- Quote creation when customer requests it
- Scheduling when quote is approved
- Status updates when work is completed
- Message drafts for common scenarios
