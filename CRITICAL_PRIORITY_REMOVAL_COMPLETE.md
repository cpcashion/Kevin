## üé® Priority System Summary

### **New 3-Tier Priority System**

| Priority | Color | Use Case |
|----------|-------|----------|

- Previously: High = 1.15x, Critical = 1.35x
- Now: High = 1.35x (emergency rates)

### **Emergency Conversations**
- Previously: Created with `.critical` priority
- Now: Created with `.high` priority

### **AI Analysis**
- Previously: Could suggest `.critical` priority
