# ⌨️ Keyboard Dismissal & @ Mentions Implementation

## ✅ COMPLETE - Two Major UX Improvements

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. ✅ Keyboard Dismissal Fix
**Problem:** Keyboard wouldn't dismiss when typing messages in issue detail page

**Solution:**
- Added `@FocusState` to track keyboard focus
- Added "Done" button in keyboard toolbar
- Keyboard automatically dismisses when sending message
- Users can now easily hide keyboard by tapping "Done"

### 2. ✅ @ Mentions System
**Problem:** No way to mention specific users in messages

**Solution:** Full @ mention system with:
- Real-time autocomplete as you type
- Location-based user filtering
- Admin vs non-admin permissions
- Automatic notifications to mentioned users
- Smart mention detection and resolution

---

## 📝 Files Created

### 1. **UserProfileService.swift**
Complete user profile and mention management service:
- `getMentionableUsers()` - Get users based on location and role
- `getAllActiveUsers()` - Get all active users (admin only)
- `getUsersAtLocation()` - Get users at specific location
- `extractMentions()` - Parse @ mentions from text
- `findUsersForMention()` - Search users for autocomplete

### 2. **MentionAutocompleteView.swift**
Beautiful autocomplete UI component:
- Shows user avatar with initials
- Displays name and email
- Shows admin badge for admins
- Smooth animations
- Tap to insert mention

---

## 🔧 Files Modified

- Deep links to issue

---

## 🎨 How It Works

### Keyboard Dismissal

**Before:**
```
User taps message field → Keyboard appears → No way to dismiss
User frustrated → Can't see content behind keyboard
```

**After:**
```
User taps message field → Keyboard appears
User taps "Done" button → Keyboard dismisses ✅
OR
User taps send → Message sent + keyboard dismisses ✅
```

### @ Mentions Flow

```
1. User types "@" in message field
   ↓
2. Autocomplete appears with mentionable users
   ↓
3. User types more letters (e.g., "@kev")
   ↓
4. List filters to matching users (Kevin)
   ↓
5. User taps user from list
   ↓
6. Mention inserted: "@Kevin " (with space)
   ↓
7. User finishes message and sends
   ↓
8. System extracts mentions from message
   ↓
9. Resolves mentions to user IDs
   ↓
10. Sends push notifications to mentioned users
```

## 👥 Permission System

### Admin Users
- ✅ Can mention **all users** from **any location**
- ✅ See all active users in autocomplete
- ✅ No location restrictions

### Non-Admin Users
- ✅ Can mention **users at their location only**
- ✅ See only users assigned to same location
- ❌ Cannot mention users from other locations

### Example

**Scenario:** Issue at "Banana Stand" location

**Admin (Kevin):**
- Can mention: John (Banana Stand), Sarah (Frozen Banana), Mike (Bluth Company)
- Sees all users regardless of location

**Non-Admin (John at Banana Stand):**
- Can mention: Kevin (admin), Sarah (if at Banana Stand)
- Cannot mention: Mike (different location)

---

## 🔍 Mention Detection

### Supported Formats

1. **Simple mentions** (no spaces):
   ```
   @kevin
   @john
   @sarah
   ```

2. **Quoted mentions** (with spaces):
   ```
   @"Kevin Admin"
   @"John Smith"
   @"Sarah Johnson"
   ```

### Extraction Examples

**Message:** "Hey @kevin, can you check this? Also @"John Smith" needs to know."

**Extracted:**
- `kevin`
- `John Smith`

**Resolved to User IDs:**
- `kevin` → `user_id_123`
- `John Smith` → `user_id_456`

**Notifications sent to:**
- User ID: `user_id_123`
- User ID: `user_id_456`

## 🎯 User Experience

### Autocomplete UI

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  @kev                                │ ← User typing
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ┌───┐                               │
│  │ K │  Kevin Admin                  │
│  └───┘  kevin@example.com     [Admin]│
│                                       │
│  ┌───┐                               │
│  │ K │  Kevin Smith                  │
│  └───┘  ksmith@example.com           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Mention in Message

**Input:**
```
@Kevin can you fix the door?
```

**Sent as:**
```
@Kevin can you fix the door?
```

**Kevin receives notification:**
```
💬 John Smith mentioned you
Banana Stand: @Kevin can you fix the door?
```

---

## 📱 Notification Details

### Mention Notification

**Title:** `💬 {mentioner} mentioned you`

**Body:** `{restaurant}: {message preview}`

**Data:**
```json
{
  "type": "mention",
  "issueId": "issue-123",
  "restaurantName": "Banana Stand",
  "mentionedBy": "John Smith",
  "message": "Full message text",
  "timestamp": 1234567890
}
```

**Deep Link:** Opens directly to the issue where they were mentioned

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### Location-Based Access Control
- Non-admins can only see users at their assigned locations
- Prevents mentioning users from unauthorized locations
- Admins have full access for coordination

### Data Protection
- User profiles stored securely in Firestore
- Location assignments tracked per user
- Only active users appear in mentions

### Firestore Structure

```
users/
  {userId}/
    id: string
    name: string
    email: string
    role: "admin" | "user"
    assignedLocations: [locationId1, locationId2]
    isActive: boolean
    createdAt: timestamp
    updatedAt: timestamp
```

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Test Keyboard Dismissal

2. **Tap message input** → Keyboard appears
3. **Tap "Done" button** → ✅ Keyboard dismisses
4. **Tap message input again**
5. **Type message and tap send** → ✅ Keyboard dismisses

### Test @ Mentions (Admin)

1. **Login as admin**
2. **Open any issue**
3. **Type "@"** → ✅ Autocomplete appears with all users

### Test @ Mentions (Non-Admin)

1. **Login as non-admin** (e.g., John at Banana Stand)
2. **Open issue at Banana Stand**

## 🎓 Technical Implementation

### Real-Time Autocomplete

```swift
// Detect @ as user types
func handleMessageTextChange(_ newValue: String) {
  if let lastAtIndex = newValue.lastIndex(of: "@") {
    let afterAt = String(newValue[newValue.index(after: lastAtIndex)...])
    
    if !afterAt.contains(" ") {
      // User is typing a mention
      currentMentionQuery = afterAt
      filteredMentionUsers = UserProfileService.shared.findUsersForMention(
        query: currentMentionQuery,
        in: mentionableUsers
      )
      showingMentionAutocomplete = !filteredMentionUsers.isEmpty
    }
  }
}
```

### Mention Insertion

```swift
func insertMention(_ user: AppUser) {
  if let lastAtIndex = newMessage.lastIndex(of: "@") {
    let beforeAt = String(newMessage[..<lastAtIndex])
    let mention = user.mentionText  // "@Kevin" or "@"John Smith""
    newMessage = beforeAt + mention + " "
    showingMentionAutocomplete = false
  }
}
```

### Notification Sending

```swift
func notifyMentionedUsers(in message: String) async {
  // 1. Extract mentions: ["kevin", "John Smith"]
  let mentions = UserProfileService.shared.extractMentions(from: message)
  
  // 2. Resolve to user IDs: ["user_123", "user_456"]
  let userIds = UserProfileService.shared.resolveMentions(
    mentions: mentions,
    from: mentionableUsers
  )
  
  // 3. Send notifications
  await NotificationService.shared.sendMentionNotification(
    to: userIds,
    issueTitle: issue.title,
    restaurantName: issue.businessId,
    message: message,
    issueId: issue.id,
    mentionedBy: currentUser.name
  )
}
```

## 📊 Performance

- **No network calls** during typing
- **Smooth animations** with SwiftUI

### Notification Performance
- **Async processing** - doesn't block UI
- **Batch notifications** - single call for multiple users
