## üö® REMAINING WORK: Database Schema & UI Terminology

### **Problem: "Restaurant" Terminology Throughout Codebase**

**535 references** to "restaurant" across **37 files** need to be evaluated and potentially renamed to be business-agnostic.

### **Key Areas Affected:**

1. **Database Schema (Firestore)**
   - `restaurantId` field in Issues, WorkOrders, Conversations
   - `restaurantName` field in various documents
   - Collection names may reference "restaurants"

2. **Data Models (Models/Entities.swift)**
   - `Restaurant` struct
   - `restaurantId` properties
   - `restaurantName` properties

3. **Services**
   - FirebaseClient.swift (95 matches)
   - SimpleLocationsService.swift (32 matches)
   - NotificationService.swift (27 matches)
   - MessagingService.swift (23 matches)

4. **UI Views**
   - ReportIssueView.swift (53 matches)
   - AdminDashboardView.swift (48 matches)
   - RestaurantHealthView.swift (41 matches)
   - IssueDetailView.swift (33 matches)

---

## üìã RECOMMENDED REFACTORING STRATEGY

### **Option 1: Alias Approach (Backward Compatible)**
Keep `restaurantId` in database but add business-agnostic aliases:
```swift
struct Business {
    let id: String
    let name: String
    // ... other properties
}

// In Issue model
var restaurantId: String  // Keep for backward compatibility
var businessId: String { restaurantId }  // Alias
var businessName: String? { restaurantName }  // Alias
```

**Pros:**
- No database migration required
- Backward compatible with existing data
- Can gradually update UI terminology

**Cons:**
- Technical debt remains
- Confusing to have both terms

### **Option 2: Full Refactoring (Clean but Complex)**
Rename everything from "restaurant" to "business":
- Database field migration: `restaurantId` ‚Üí `businessId`
- Model updates: `Restaurant` ‚Üí `Business`
- UI updates: All user-facing text

**Pros:**
- Clean, accurate terminology
- Future-proof for all business types

**Cons:**
- Requires Firestore data migration
- Risk of breaking existing functionality
- Large scope of changes

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)**
1. **Keep database fields as-is** (`restaurantId`, `restaurantName`)
2. **Add type aliases in code:**
   ```swift
   typealias BusinessId = String
   typealias Business = Restaurant
   ```
3. **Update UI text only:**
   - "Restaurant" ‚Üí "Business"
   - "Restaurant Name" ‚Üí "Business Name"
   - "Select Restaurant" ‚Üí "Select Business"

**Pros:**
- No database migration
- Minimal code changes
- User-facing terminology is correct
- Low risk

**Cons:**
- Internal code still uses "restaurant" terminology
- Some technical debt remains

---

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### **1. Update User-Facing Text (High Priority)**
Search and replace in UI strings:
- "Restaurant" ‚Üí "Business"
- "restaurant" ‚Üí "business"
- Files to focus on:
  - All View files (Features/)
  - Success messages
  - Error messages
  - Onboarding text

### **2. Update Marketing Materials**
- App Store description
- Onboarding screens
- Help documentation
- Any "restaurant-specific" language

### **3. Add Business Type Field (Future Enhancement)**
Consider adding a `businessType` field to track what kind of business:
```swift
struct Business {
    let id: String
    let name: String
    let type: BusinessType  // NEW
    
    enum BusinessType: String {
        case restaurant
        case hardwareStore
        case salon
        case gym
        case veterinary
        // ... etc
    }
}
```

This enables:
- Business-specific maintenance categories
- Targeted marketing
- Industry-specific features

## üìä Files Requiring Review

### **High Priority (User-Facing)**
1. ReportIssueView.swift (53 matches)
2. AdminDashboardView.swift (48 matches)
3. RestaurantHealthView.swift (41 matches) - Rename to BusinessHealthView
4. IssueDetailView.swift (33 matches)
5. AdminRestaurantDetailView.swift (19 matches) - Rename to AdminBusinessDetailView

### **Medium Priority (Internal)**
1. FirebaseClient.swift (95 matches)
2. SimpleLocationsService.swift (32 matches)
3. Entities.swift (27 matches)
4. NotificationService.swift (27 matches)
5. MessagingService.swift (23 matches)

### **Low Priority (Backend/Models)**
- Can use aliases and keep internal naming for now
